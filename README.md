# Automatically drafting an engaging blog post based on an academic publication

## Assignment

Generative AI agents are expected to gradually automate routine computer tasks. One such task is producing engaging content oriented to the general public from technical scientific publications.

The student will:
- Review existing recommendations for writing engaging blog posts based on scientific papers
- Review existing works on predicting virality/engagement of a social network post
- Review the available Large Language Models suitable for creating LLM agents
- Create a dataset of papers, corresponding blog posts and the estimates of their success/engagement
- Create a prediction model for predicting the engagement of a blog post based on an LLM
- Design and implement a system that will use LLMs to automatically turn a given scientific paper into a blog post that follows the recommendations and optimizes the engagement
- Evaluate and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the implemented system
