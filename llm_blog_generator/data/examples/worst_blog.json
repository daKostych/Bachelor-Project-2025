Early approaches used a layer-based structure, but this was limited by processing queries one agent at a time. The Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) method improved on this by allowing simultaneous processing of queries by multiple agents, with an aggregator combining their outputs.\n\nHowever, MoA faces two main challenges:\n\n1. High computational costs: While MoA is faster, it requires more overall computational power, which limits scalability and efficiency.\n\n2. Lack of diverse thinking: MoA agents tend to generate similar responses, reducing effectiveness in tasks requiring varied perspectives.\n\nTo address these issues, the authors propose Sparse Mixture-of-Agents (SMoA), inspired by sparse mixture-of-experts (SMoE) designs. SMoA introduces two new agent types:\n\n1. Judge LLM: Selects high-quality responses for the next round.\n2. Moderator LLM: Controls information flow and decides when to end the process.\n\nThis approach aims to reduce unnecessary data processing, improving efficiency and scalability. Additionally, SMoA assigns distinct roles to each agent, promoting diverse thinking and problem-solving approaches. This design is influenced by the expert diversity principle used in SMoE to balance workload among experts.\n\nBy implementing these changes, SMoA seeks to overcome the limitations of previous multi-agent LLM systems and enhance their practical utility.\n\nThe key contributions of the paper are:\n\n1. Identification of limitations in existing multi-agent LLM frameworks:\nThe authors highlight two main issues with current approaches, particularly the Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) method:\n\u2014 High token computational cost, which limits scalability and efficiency\n\u2014 Lack of diverse thinking among LLM agents, leading to homogenized responses\n\n2. Proposal of a novel architecture \u2014 Sparse Mixture-of-Agents (SMoA):\nThis new approach is designed to address the limitations of existing frameworks by:\n\u2014 Introducing sparsity in agent interactions through two new agent types: Judge LLM and Moderator LLM\n\u2014 Assigning distinct roles to each LLM agent to promote diverse thinking\n\n3. Experimental validation:\nThe authors conducted extensive experiments across various tasks to demonstrate that:\n\u2014 SMoA achieves comparable performance to MoA\n\u2014 SMoA uses significantly fewer computational resources than MoA\n\n4. In-depth analysis and insights:\nThe paper provides:\n\u2014 A comparison of different multi-agent methods\n\u2014 Detailed discussion of the advantages of SMoA over existing approaches\n\nThese contributions aim to advance the field of multi-agent LLM systems by improving efficiency, scalability, and diversity of thinking while maintaining high performance levels. The SMoA architecture represents a significant step forward in addressing the challenges faced by current multi-agent LLM frameworks.",
